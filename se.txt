<Chloe McManus. I went to highschool at Fairview High School in Erie, PA. I was on the the volleyball and softball teams all through out highschool. I was also on my school’s FIRST Robotics team. That was how I found out about RIT. The finger lakes regional was held here. The only thing I did not like about RIT when I went was how much snow was on the ground. I love skiing and snowboarding, but I hate being cold. So, it’s kind of fun that I went to RIT. My favorite food is red velvet cake.>
